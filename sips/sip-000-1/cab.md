# Consideration Advisory Board Duties

There is an Advisory Board for each SIP consideration, with a designated
chairperson responsible for maintaining copies of all discussion and feedback on
the SIPs under consideration.

## Membership

All Consideration Advisory Boards begin their life as unofficial working
groups of users who wish to review inbound SIPs according to their collective expertise. If they wish to be recognized as an official Consideration Advisory Board, they shall submit a SIP to the Steering Committee per the procedure described in the [Steering Committee’s duties](steering-committee.md) document.

Each Consideration Advisory Board shall be formally created by the SC with a designated member serving as its first interim chairperson. After this, the Consideration Advisory Board may adopt its own bylaws (link to usable bylaw) for selecting members and chairpeople. However, members should have domain expertise relevant to the consideration.

## Members

Members shall serve on their respective Consideration Advisory Boards so long as they are in good standing with the SIP Code of Conduct and in accordance to the individual Board’s bylaws. 

A user may serve on at most 3 (three) Consideration Advisory Boards concurrently.

## Qualifications

Each Consideration Advisory Board member shall have sufficient domain expertise to provide the Steering Committee with feedback pertaining to a SIP's consideration. Members shall possess excellent written communication skills.

## Responsibilities

Each Consideration Advisory Board shall be responsible for the following.

### Chairperson

Each Consideration Advisory Board shall appoint a chairperson, who shall serve as the point of contact between the rest of the Board and the Steering Committee. If the chairperson becomes unresponsive, the SC may ask the Board to appoint a new chairperson (alternatively, the Board may appoint a new chairperson on its own and inform the SC).

The chairperson shall be responsible for maintaining the Board’s public list of members’ names and contact information as a supplementary document to the SIP that the SC ratified to recognize the Board.

### Consideration Track

Each Consideration Advisory Board shall provide a clear and concise description of what expertise it can offer, so that SIP authors may solicit it with confidence that it will be helpful. The chairperson shall make this description available to the Steering Committee and to the SIP Editors, so that both committees can help SIP authors ensure that they receive the most appropriate feedback.

The description shall be provided and updated by the chairperson to the SC so that the SC can provide a public index of all considerations a SIP may possess.

### Feedback

Feedback to SIP Authors Each Consideration Advisory Board shall provide a full, fair, public, and timely evaluation of any Accepted-status SIP that lists the Board's consideration in its preamble. The Board may decide to move each SIP to a Recommended status or a Rejected status based on whether or not the Board believes that the SIP is feasible, practical, and beneficial to the greater Stacks ecosystem.

Any feedback created shall be made public. It is the responsibility of the Board to store and publish all feedback for the SIPs it reviews. It shall forward copies of this feedback to both the SIP authors.

### Consultation with the Steering Committee

The Steering Committee may need to follow up with the Consideration Advisory Board in order to clarify its position or solicit its advice on a particular SIP. For example, the SC may determine that a Recommended SIP needs to be considered by one or more additional Boards that have not yet been consulted by the SIP authors.

The Board shall respond to the SC's request for advice in a timely manner, and shall prioritize feedback on SIPs that are under consideration for ratification.
