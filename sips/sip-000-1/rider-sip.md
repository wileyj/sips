# Rider SIPs

Certain proposals may include dependent or secondary components requiring independent handling.

## Definition

A **Rider SIP** is a secondary proposal that depends on or extends another SIP.

## When Rider SIPs Are Used

- Clarifying or supplementing already-voted proposals
- Documentation updates
- Activation detail adjustments (**example:** An already voted on activation height needs to be changed to a later date)
- Parameter modifications

## Approval Process

- If the Rider only clarifies an existing SIP, it may be approved alongside the parent SIP
- The Steering Committee and SIP Deputies determine when a Rider requires separate ratification

## Activation Height Updates via Rider

When post-vote coordination necessitates activation-height changes:

1. Create a short Rider SIP or amendment
2. Include rationale and approvals from CABs and Deputies
3. Provide clear changelog linking to parent SIP
