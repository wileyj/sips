# SIP Considerations

Each SIP is evaluated under one or more **Considerations**, which identify the
domain expertise required for review as well as the specific criteria used for
ratification. Every Consideration has a corresponding [Advisory Board (CAB)](committees.md#committee-mprovements)
responsible for vetting SIPs within its domain and determining whether they are
eligible to advance.

New Considerations may be added through a **Meta** SIP under the
**Governance** consideration.

## Types of SIP Considerations

### Technical
Covers SIPs that introduce or modify technical functionality, protocol
behaviors, or system architecture. SIPs under this consideration must be
reviewed by contributors with relevant technical expertise (e.g., protocol
engineering, cryptography, smart contracts).

### Economic
Applies to SIPs affecting token economics or incentive structures, including:
- STX token dynamics  
- On-chain assets created via smart contracts  
- Fundraising mechanisms  
- Grants, bounties, and incentive programs  

### Governance
Covers SIPs that modify governance processes or structures in the Stacks
ecosystem. Examples include:
- Amendments to the SIP process  
- Creation or dissolution of committees or roles  
- Changes to selection or removal procedures for committee members  

### Ethics
Applies to SIPs that define or reinforce behavioral expectations for
contributors, reviewers, or decision-makers. SIPs may involve:
- Codes of conduct  
- Conflict resolution procedures  
- Participation requirements  
- Policies addressing misconduct and remediation  

### Diversity
Includes SIPs focused on broadening participation in the Stacks ecosystem,
especially among underrepresented groups. Relevant topics include:
- Outreach and education initiatives  
- Evangelism and onboarding strategies  
- Inclusion-focused programs or policies  

## Using SIP Considerations

A SIP may have **multiple Considerations** if it spans more than one domain
(e.g., a technical SIP with economic implications). Each relevant CAB must
review the SIP and provide sign-off before it can advance through the
ratification process.

Different Considerations may require different review timelines, criteria, and
subject-matter expertise.
